# Number-Plate-Recognition-System
Automatic Number Plate Recognition System is the identification system of vehicles. It is an  image processing technology used to identify the vehicles only by their license plates.  Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) plays a major role in management of parking  areas, and surveillance of illegally parked vehicles. The identification is also employed for managing parking facilities, monitoring and analysis of traveling time, and security systems such as observation of stolen vehicles and monitoring of unauthorized vehicles entering private areas. For enhancement of scene MATLAB’s image processing toolbox is used this toolbox provide some built-in functions for reading image, cropping it, converting it into binary image then labeling it for accessing the text in the scene. For machine learning MATLAB’s Neural Network toolbox is used. First of all system need to train on some collected number plate data and cross validate and repeat that process until machine get learned. When machine learned successfully then further processing will take place. The input of the system is the image of a vehicle captured by a camera. The captured image is taken from 2 – 3 feet away. That image is processed through Number Plate Extractor (NPE) with give its output to segmentation part.Finally recognition part recognize the characters through the trained Neural Network and result the plate number.
